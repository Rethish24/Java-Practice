# Java-Practice
...I am starting my  programming journey  

Date:- 5/1/2026
As i have some prior knowledge in the java language 
,today as a part of Aptitude learning (Divisibility Rules) along understanding the concept i have written code for respective divisibility rules

Starting from Scratch( Basics of JAVA )
Key Points:-
1.java is high level language(very close the human being understanding).
2.Every Statement in java ends witha semicolon(;).Like in english a sentence ends with fullstop(.)
3.Java is case sensitive S <--×--> s.
4.Sequential Flow of Execution of the program .
5.Difference between System.out.print() and System.out.println().
6.Comments and their purpose in the program/code.( // ---->Single line comment && /*  */ ---->Multi line comment).
7.Escape Sequences and their function ( \n , \t , \" , \', \\,\b).

About compiler and interpreter and difference between them .

1.Compiler - 
A Translator that converts /transforms the source code into byte code("Intermediate code/Assembly Language").
compiles all the code at once and displays the errors at specific lines 
The compliation becomes succesful if and only if all the errors are resolved and the program runs.
*** Advantage of compiled languages have less run time than interpreted languages.
(Half/semi transaltion +error checking )

2.Interpreter -
A Translator that interprets the source code into machine code("binary Language") at run time.
interprets the code line by line and displays the error directly when it occurs and it stops the process of interpretation.

But , unlike the compiler the previous output of the code before the error arises is diplayed succesfully.

Remaining code is interpreted after the error in the particular is resloved.

*** More run time than compiled languages .(transaltion +error checking)

       Language                               (intermediate code)                 


       *** JAVA is both compiled and interpreted language and is faster than python becoz of less run time .
    ** UNITS of memory in computers
    (Bit)Binary Digit -- 0 & 1
    **** 8 bits = 1 byte.
    **** 4 bits = 1 nibble.

    10*3 bytes = 1 KB(kilo) 
    10*6 bytes = 1 MB(mega)
    10*9 bytes = 1 GB(giga)

    Fundamentals of computer program:
    
    1.variables that contain data
    2.Algorithm
    3.Control flow(conditionals/loops)
